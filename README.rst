Project Preface
===============

Motivation
++++++++++

This first |course| project for |semester| is designed to help you apply and extend your
prerequisite Java programming knowledge with new concepts from |course| in a Unix development
environment (i.e., |server|).

If you are competent with the learning outcomes for CSCI 1301 (i.e., the prerequisite course), then
you already have most of the Java programming knowledge required to complete this project;
otherwise, this assignment will help you identify the gaps in your prerequisite programming
knowledge so that you can tackle those gaps early in the semester. We also recommend completing the
`Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment <https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw0.5>`_ before beginning this project.

This project will also require you to apply some of the new concepts covered in |course|, including
named packages, exception (creating and handling), and Java development in a Unix environment. If
you have actively engaged with the |course| course content offered so far this semester, then you
should be able to comfortably, but not necessarily quickly, complete those aspects of the project by
applying what you have practiced and learned from your content engagement.

Finally, this project may require you to do things that you have never been given explicit
directions or instructions for — this is just a part of software development. In such cases, you
may need need to do some research to help you plan your solution. That being said, we have
carefully prepared this project description document so that it hopefully answers the majority of
your questions. If not, then please do not hesitate to ask a question on the course
|discussion_board| or during office hours.

Academic Honesty
++++++++++++++++

All students at the University of Georgia explicitly agree to abide by the UGA student honor code
when they sign the application for their admission to the University. Additionally, all students
enrolled in a |course| course section in |semester| are subject to the Academic Honesty policy
included in the |semester| |course| course syllabus. Furthermore, anyone with access to this
project description document is expected to respect the copyright and licensing terms provided or
linked to at the bottom of this document.

With academic honesty in mind, we ask all |semester| |course| students not to fork this repository
on GitHub. Doing so may make your copy of the project publicly visible, and that can  violate
several of the policies described earlier. Instead of forking the repository, please follow the
instructions provided later in this document to acquire a copy of the project description and
starter code.

Course-Specific Learning Outcomes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Project Updates
+++++++++++++++

If your instructor updates the project's requirements or starter code before the project is due,
then this section will be updated to include a summary of those updates and, if needed,
instructions that describe how to update your working copy of the project with
the latest versions of any changed files.

Project Description
===================

.. |gameutil_api_here| replace:: here
.. _gameutil_api_here: https://cs1302uga.github.io/cs1302-c4-alpha/doc

Introduction
++++++++++++

In this project, you will implement and test a class that represents the popular board game
`Connect Four <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four>`_. Connect Four is a two-player connection game involving
a two-dimensional grid of tokens. Here are the basic rules for Connect Four:

* To prepare a new game of Connect Four, the grid is setup to accommodate an acceptable number
  of rows and columns; however, it should not yet contain any tokens.
* To get ready to play, both players are assigned a unique token.
* To play the game, both players take turns "dropping" copies of their token into non-full
  columns in the grid. When a token is dropped, it falls to the lowest position in the
  column that does not yet contain a token.
* To win the game, a player must strategically drop their tokens so that four of them connect
  inside the grid — they are allowed to connect horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
* The game is over once all positions in the grid a filled or when a player wins the game.

The class that you will implement and test will be expected to provide the high-level
functionality described above via its constructor and instance methods — the specific details
about what is required are included later in this document. What you are about to read may
seem counter-intuitive, but **you will not be writing any code for this project to let users
interactively play a game of Connect Four**; instead, you will implement and test a class that,
once fully implemented, can be used to make writing such an interactive program easier. This is
similar to what you did in the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment earlier this semester.

Getting Started
+++++++++++++++

**You will not be starting from scratch.** Instead, starter code is provided that you will
need to download to get started, then modify and test to meet the project's
requirements. To download the starter code, follow these instructions:

1. Login to |server|.
2. If you have not done so, we recommend creating a separate directory inside of your home directory to store all of your |course| projects instead of having them all directly
   inside your home directory.
3. Change to your |course| projects directory.
4. Execute the following command to download the starter code into a sub-directory called |ttslug|::

   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-c4-alpha.git

5. Change to the |ttslug| directory that was just created, then use the ``tree`` command to
   verify that you now have a copy of the starter code under ``src``::

     $ tree src
     src
     └── cs1302
         └── game
             ├── ConnectFour.java
             ├── ConnectFourCLI.java
             └── ConnectFourTester.java

Project Checklist
=================

To help you with planning out this project, here are some suggested steps you can take that your
instructors believe will help you complete the project more easily. Some of the items in this
checklist may not make sense until you have read the entire project description. These steps are
suggestions and, therefore, do not constitute an exhaustive list of the steps that you may need to
take to complete the project.

.. |code_style| replace:: code style
.. _code_style: https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide/#when-and-how-to-check

Prepare
+++++++

:Target: Finish before |date_target_prep|.

1. Read through the entire project description, including any `appendices <#appendices>`_,
   **and write down questions as you go**.

2. We recommend reading the project description again. A second read-through will help you fill in gaps in your
   understanding and you may be able to answer some of the questions you wrote down during your first read-through.

Plan
++++

:Target: Finish before |date_target_plan|.

1. If you have not yet done so, `download the starter code <#getting-started>`_ on |server|.

2. Read all of the comments included in ``src/cs1302/game/ConnectFour.java``, but
   **do not write any code yet!** Instead, try to list out the high-level steps for
   the constructor and methods using a sequence of distinct steps that you can turn into
   code later.

3. Read through the notes you just wrote. If you see that the steps you wrote for one method
   include a sequence of steps in another method, then consider whether you can have one
   method can call the other — that's code reuse which will greatly minimize bugs in your code! 
   If you see the exact same steps in several methods, you should consider factoring out the 
   common parts into a single, separate method that you can call from both places — that's 
   code reuse and refactoring!

4. Read all of the comments included in ``src/cs1302/game/ConnectTester.java``.

Implement
+++++++++

:Target: Finish before |date_target_impl|.

1. Implement the ``ConnectFour(int, int)`` constructor, ensure it's written with good
   |code_style|_, then test it by writing a few lines of code in the ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester`` class
   to make sure the constructor only throws an exception when the board size is too large/too small. Also, your
   code should print out the instance variables of the ``ConnectFour`` object to make sure they are consistent
   with the diagrams in this document.

   * There are a few example test methods given in ``ConnectFourTester.java``. However, those methods are not
     currently called from the ``main`` method. The provided tests are meant to test
     the full gameplay which requires all methods to be implemented. We will revisit this in a later step below.

2. Implement the ``getRows()`` and ``getCols()`` methods, ensure they are written with good |code_style|_, then 
   test them by adding test code to the ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester`` class in a manner that is
   consistent with your constructor test code. You will want to, at a minimum, print out the return value from
   valid calls to ``getRows`` and ``getCols`` along with the instance variables from the ``ConnectFour`` object 
   to make sure they are consistent.

3. Repeat this process to implement, check |code_style|_, and test the remaining methods in the
   order that they appear in the ``ConnectFour.java`` starter code.

4. As mentioned in the comments in ``ConnectFourTester.java``, the provided tests do not cover all of the 
   input scenarios that need to be tested. You should add methods to test additional scenarios. Please
   note that you can also test your code using the ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI`` class and by using
   input redirection as discussed in class.

Review
++++++

:Target: Finish before |date_target_revu|.

1. Do one final pass through the project document to make sure that you didn't miss anything.
2. Run your code through your test cases one last time.
3. Check your |code_style|_.
4. Run your code through the ``ConnectFourTester.java`` program and ensure that all of your test cases are passed.
5. Play your game using the provided ``ConnectFourCLI.java`` program.
6. Check your |code_style|_ one last time.
7. `Submit your code <#submission-instructions>`_ on Odin.

Project Requirements
====================

.. _freqs:

Functional Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A *functional requirement* defines a specific behavior between program inputs and outputs,
and a collection of functional requirements describes how a program should function. If
your submission satisfies a functional requirement listed in this section, then the
requirement's point total is added to your submission grade.

.. _connect_four_reqs:

cs1302.game.ConnectFour
-----------------------

The ``cs1302.game.ConnectFour`` class is one of the classes that you are responsible for
implementing and testing. When you downloaded the starter code, a partially implemented version of
this class was included under the project's ``src`` directory:

:Source: ``src/cs1302/game/ConnectFour.java``
:FQN: ``cs1302.game.ConnectFour``
:Package Name: ``cs1302.game``
:Simple Name: ``ConnectFour``

When you implement this class, you will not have much leeway in terms of the class's overall design;
however, you are free to add additional instance methods, as needed, to improve readability and
code reuse. The specific details regarding what you are explicitly not permitted to do are explained
later in the `Non-Functional Requirements <#non-functional-requirements>`_ section.

It should also be noted that the ``ConnectFour`` class depends on some classes that we have included
in ``lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar``. You do not have access to the source code for the classes in that Java
ARchive (JAR) file; however, API documentation for those classes is provided |gameutil_api_here|_. The
compilation instructions that we include below will ensure that these dependencies are available
on the classpath so that the compiler can find them.

How to Compile
**************

To compile ``ConnectFour.java``, execute the following command while directly inside the
|ttslug| directory::

   $ javac -cp lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar -d bin src/cs1302/game/ConnectFour.java

Once compiled, you can begin to test the ``ConnectFour`` class by modifying and running the
`provided tester class <#cs1302gameconnectfourtester>`_.

Game Phases
***********

.. |GamePhase| replace:: ``cs1302.gameutil.GamePhase``
.. _GamePhase: https://cs1302uga.github.io/cs1302-c4-alpha/doc/cs1302/gameutil/GamePhase.html

Your implementation of ``cs1302.game.ConnectFour`` is expected to support the multiple phases
defined by the |GamePhase|_ enumeration. When a ``ConnectFour`` game object is constructed, it's
said to be in the ``GamePhase.NEW`` phase — that just means that ``GamePhase.NEW`` is assigned
to the object's ``phase`` instance variable. The game object may move into other phases as methods
are called on it. The behavior of some methods depends on the phase the object is in when called.
Here is a high-level overview of all the required phases and the methods that trigger a game
object to change what phase it is in:

.. image:: img/phases.png
   :width: 100%

The details for each game phase are provided below:

``GamePhase.NEW``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A newly constructed game is in this phase.**

When a ``ConnectFour`` object is created, the constructor should check for any exceptional cases,
then initialize the object's instance variables to the values described below:

:``rows``:            the supplied value of the ``rows`` constructor parameter
:``cols``:            the supplied value of the ``cols`` constructor parameter
:``grid``:            a two-dimensional ``Token`` array with ``rows``-many rows and ``cols``-many columns
:``player``:          a one-dimensional ``Token`` array of length ``2``
:``numDropped``:      the ``int`` value ``0``
:``lastDropRow``:     the ``int`` value ``-1``
:``lastDropCol``:     the ``int`` value ``-1``
:``phase``:           ``GamePhase.NEW``

Below is an example of some code that constructs a game object with six rows and seven columns followed
by an illustration of what the inside of that object should look like when it's done being constructed:

.. code-block:: java

   ConnectFour game = new ConnectFour(6, 7);

.. image:: img/GamePhase.NEW.png
   :width: 100%

``GamePhase.READY``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A game that is ready to be played is in this phase.**

A game object that is in the ``GamePhase.NEW`` phase should move into the ``GamePhase.READY``
phase when its ``setPlayerTokens`` method is called for the first time.

Below is an example of some code that sets the player tokens of a game object in the
``GamePhase.NEW`` phase followed by an illustration of what the inside of that object
should look like immediately after the code has executed and the object is in the
``GamePhase.READY`` phase:

.. code-block:: java

   game.setPlayerTokens(Token.RED, Token.BLUE);

.. image:: img/GamePhase.READY.png
   :width: 100%

``GamePhase.PLAYABLE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A game that is being played is in this phase.**

A game object that is in the ``GamePhase.READY`` phase should move into the ``GamePhase.PLAYABLE``
phase when its ``dropToken`` method is called for the first time.

Below is an example of some code that drops several tokens into the grid of a game object
in the ``GamePhase.READY`` phase. Each line of code is followed by an illustration of what
the inside of that object should look like immediately after the line has been executed.
Please note that the object is in the ``GamePhase.PLAYABLE`` phase immediately after
the first line has executed:

.. code-block:: java

   game.dropToken(0, 0); // first player, column 0

.. image:: img/GamePhase.PLAYABLE.1.png
   :width: 100%

.. code-block:: java

   game.dropToken(1, 1); // second player, column 1

.. image:: img/GamePhase.PLAYABLE.2.png
   :width: 100%

.. code-block:: java

   game.dropToken(0, 1); // first player, column 1

.. image:: img/GamePhase.PLAYABLE.3.png
   :width: 100%

.. code-block:: java

   game.dropToken(1, 2); // second player, column 2

.. image:: img/GamePhase.PLAYABLE.4.png
   :width: 100%

``GamePhase.OVER``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A game that has ended is in this phase.**

A game object that is in the ``GamePhase.PLAYABLE`` phase should move into the ``GamePhase.OVER``
phase when its ``isLastDropConnectFour`` method is called and one of the following conditions
are met:

* the grid is full; or
* the method is about to return ``true`` because the last drop created a *connect four*.

Consider the following illustration of a game object that is currently in the
``GamePhase.PLAYABLE`` phase:

.. image:: img/GamePhase.OVER.PRE.png
   :width: 100%

Below is an example of some code that drops a winning token into the grid of the game object
depicted above, then checks for that win using the object's ``isLastDropConnectFour`` method.
The code is followed by an illustration of what the inside of that object should look like
immediately after the code has been executed. Please note that the object moves into the ``GamePhase.OVER``
phase immediately after the last call to ``isLastDropConnectFour()`` has executed:

.. code-block:: java

   game.dropToken(1, 4); // second player, column 4

   if (game.isLastDropConnectFour()) {
       System.out.println("second player has won!");
   } // if

.. image:: img/GamePhase.OVER.POST.png
   :width: 100%

Specific Requirements
*********************

:Implementation (100 points):
   Your ``cs1302.game.ConnectFour`` implementation is expected to function as described in the API
   documentation included in the starter code and as described in the `Game Phases <#game-phases>`_
   section presented earlier in this document. To be clear, your program should not only meet these
   expectations under normal conditions; it should also meet them under exceptional conditions — some
   of the sample test cases we provided in the starter code demonstrate how to test a behavior when
   an exception is involved.

   After the due date, it will be tested using several test cases that you will not have access to ahead
   of time. The test methods that you write in your ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester`` class will help you
   prepare your implementation, but they will not be used to determine your grade.

cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester
-----------------------------

The ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester`` class is where you will write code to test your
``cs1302.game.ConnectFour`` class. When you downloaded the starter code, a partially
implemented version of this class was included under the project's ``src`` directory:

:Source: ``src/cs1302/game/ConnectFourTester.java``
:FQN: ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester``
:Package Name: ``cs1302.game``
:Simple Name: ``ConnectFourTester``

You should use this tester class to help you test the constructor and methods of
your ``ConnectFour`` class under different scenarios. In many respects, you have a lot
of leeway. The specific details regarding what you are explicitly not permitted to do are explained
later in the `Non-Functional Requirements <#non-functional-requirements>`_ section.

It should also be noted that the ``ConnectFourTester`` class depends on some classes that we have included
in ``lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar``. You do not have access to the source code for the classes in that Java
ARchive (JAR) file; however, API documentation for those classes is provided |gameutil_api_here|_. The
compilation instructions that we include below will ensure that these dependencies are available
on the classpath so that the compiler can find them.

How to Compile and Run
**********************

To compile ``ConnectFourTester.java``, you need to first (re)compile ``ConnectFour.java``, then
run the following command directly inside the |ttslug| directory::

   $ javac -cp bin:lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar -d bin src/cs1302/game/ConnectFourTester.java

Once compiled, you can run ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester`` using ``java``::

  $ java -cp bin:lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester

Specific Requirements
*********************

There are no functional requirements for ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourTester``. Just keep in mind that
you are expected to use it to help you test your code.

cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI
--------------------------

The ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI`` class provides a command-line program to let users play your
game. When you downloaded the starter code, an implemented version of this program was
included under the project's ``src`` directory:

:Source: ``src/cs1302/game/ConnectFourCLI.java``
:FQN: ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI``
:Package Name: ``cs1302.game``
:Simple Name: ``ConnectFourCLI``

This command-line program does not replace the testing that you are asked to do in ``ConnectFourTester``. Instead,
it is provided to give you a way to play your game, assuming it is implemented properly. It may also help you 
when you debug your code.

How to Compile and Run
**********************

To compile ``ConnectFourCLI.java``, you need to first (re)compile ``ConnectFour.java``, then
run the following command directly inside the |ttslug| directory::

   $ javac -cp bin:lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar -d bin src/cs1302/game/ConnectFourCLI.java

Once compiled, you can run ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI`` using ``java``::

  $ java -cp bin:lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI

Specific Requirements
*********************

There are no functional requirements for ``cs1302.game.ConnectFourCLI``. Just keep in mind that
you are expected to use it to help you test your code.

Non-Functional Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A *non-functional requirement* specifies criteria that can be used to judge your submission
independently from its function or behavior. If functional requirements describe what your
submission should *do*, then the non-functional requirements describe how your submission is
supposed to *be*. If your submission does not satisfy a non-functional requirement listed in
this section, then the requirement's point total is deducted from your submission grade.

.. |compile_points| replace:: 100
.. |style_points_each| replace:: 5
.. |style_points_max| replace:: 20

Environment and Structure (|compile_points|)
----------------------------------------------

This project must compile and run correctly on |server| using the specific version of
Java that is enabled by the CSCI 1302 shell profile, and your directory structure and
package structure should match the structure of the starter code.

* You should NOT modify the location of any of the provided ``.java`` files.

* You should NOT modify the package statement in any of the provided ``.java`` files.

* The location of the default package for source code should be a direct sub-directory of
  |ttslug| called ``src``. The only ``.java`` files that you should include are your modified
  versions of the ones in the starter code — **you should NOT add any additional source code files**.
  Both ``ConnectFour.java``, ``ConnectFourTester.java``, and
  ``ConnectFourCLI.java`` are expected to compile on |server| using the commands provided in 
  the compilation instructions that are included earlier in this document.

* The location of the default package for compiled code should be a sub-directory of |ttslug|
  called ``bin``. If you include compiled code with your submission, then it will be ignored.
  Graders are instructed to recompile your submission on |server| code before testing your
  submission.

If a problem is encountered for your submission that is explicitly described above, then
|compile_points| points will be subtracted from your earned point total; however, if the
problem is compilation-related or structure-related and NOT explicitly described above, then
it will be handled on an individual basis.

Code Style (|style_points_max|)
-------------------------------

Every ``.java`` file that you include as part of your submission for this project must
be in valid style as defined in the 
`CS1302 Code Style Guide <https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide>`_. 
All of the individual code style guidelines listed in the style guide document are considered 
for this requirement.

If ``check1302`` on |server| reports any style violations for your submission, then
|style_points_each| points will be subtracted from your earned point total **for each
violation**, up to a maximum deduction of |style_points_max| points.

.. _styleguide: https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide

Submission Instructions
+++++++++++++++++++++++

You will submit your project on |server|. Before you submit, make sure that your project files are
located in a directory called |ttslug|. If you followed the instructions provided earlier in this
document to download the project, then that is your directory name. To submit, change into the
parent of your project directory (i.e., one directory above it), then complete the steps below:

1. Check your code style — we know that you have done this frequently, but it does not hurt to
   double-check it before you submit::

     $ check1302 cs1302-c4-alpha

   If there are style violations, then fix them and retest your code!

2. Once you have no style guide violations and your code compiles and works, you can submit your
   work using the following command::

     $ submit cs1302-c4-alpha csci-1302

3. Inspect the output of the last command to verify that your project was submitted. Your
   |ttslug| directory should now contain a ``rec`` (receipt) file.

If you have any problems submitting your project then please contact your instructor as soon as
possible; however, doing this the day or night the project is due is probably not the best idea.

In Java, ``.jar`` files are Java™ Archive (JAR) files that bundle multiple files into a single
compressed file. Typically a JAR file contains the package directories and ``.class`` files for
a library. This is just like the ``bin`` directory that you are used to, except it is all bundled
into a single file. For example, the ``lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar`` file contains the package directories
and ``.class`` files for the classes and enumerations defined in ``cs1302.gameutil`` package. If you
are in the |ttslug| directory, then you can use the following command to take a peek into the
archive::

  $ jar -tf lib/cs1302-gameutil.jar

You should notice that the top-level directory in the JAR file is ``cs1302``, which means that
the JAR file itself can serve as the default package for compiled code — this is why we use ``-cp``
in examples given elsewhere in this project description.
